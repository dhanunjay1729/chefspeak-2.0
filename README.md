# 🍳 ChefSpeak – Your Voice‑Enabled Cooking Companion

ChefSpeak is a **multilingual, voice‑assisted recipe app** designed to make cooking simpler, smarter, and hands‑free.
It’s built to go **beyond a simple LLM wrapper**, combining AI‑generated recipes, dish images, and interactive cooking features — all in one place.

> ⚠️ **Note:** ChefSpeak is currently in **active development**. Features are being added and improved continuously.

## ✨ Features (Current & In Progress)

✅ **AI‑Generated Recipes**
Type (or speak) the dish name, specify the number of servings, and add notes — ChefSpeak fetches clear, numbered step‑by‑step instructions in your preferred language.

✅ **Dish Images Integration**
Automatically fetches a high‑quality image of the dish from Unsplash to give you a visual reference.

✅ **Multilingual Support**
Select your preferred language (e.g., English, Telugu, Hindi) and ChefSpeak will respond and narrate accordingly.

✅ **Voice Navigation**
After loading the recipe, you can say commands like **“next”**, **“repeat”**, and **“back”** to move through steps without touching your screen.

✅ **Timer Ready** *(planned)*
Steps that mention cooking durations will soon have a one‑tap **Start Timer** button — making it easier to follow along.

✅ **Nutrition Insights** *(in development)*
Get approximate calories, protein, carbs, and fat for each recipe per serving, powered by GPT.

✅ **Personalization & Saved Recipes** *(planned)*
Mark your favorite recipes, add notes like “reduce chili next time,” and build your personal cookbook.
